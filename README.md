# CarCommunity
Help out community members and combat those awful alternate side/hydrant/meter parking tickets!

Problem

As a relatively new New Yorker, alternate sides really frustrate me. You can also get an expensive ticket for a variety of other parking infractions.

Solution

Do you ever pass a car parked on the wrong side as alternate side hours begin and wish you could notify the owner? Well, with Car Community you can!
With CarCommunity you can enter any license plate number, and if the owner of that car is a CarCommunity member it will securely and privately send him/her an email with the message you have selected from our list of options.

More Details

The CarCommunity web application currently contains 5 pages- Sign Up, Login, Your Stats, Send A Message, and Future Plans.

Technical Notes

This web app uses an app I built using Loopback, and Javascript on the backend. (There is also a little PHP for the email feature, but since the project is not deployed it is not currently working.)
The front end was built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and Ajax.
I am particularly proud because I created CarCommunity in just a few hours for Queens College's HackAttack!
